This history is the most important facet of treatment as it allows me to navigate the intricacies of every unique person I work with. Nothing is cookie cutter because no two nervous systems are the same or have had the same experiences. Together, we then create a unique and detailed treatment plan that aligns with each client’s goals and needs."
